     <h3>Karla & Josefin Sans</h3><br>
        <p><b>Karla</b> Karla is a grotesque sans serif family designed for the Latin and Tamil scripts.This is the Latin part of the family, which has been expanded now to a variable font with a weight axis ranging from ExtraLight to ExtraBold plus full support of Western, Central, and South-Eastern European languages.</p><p><b>Josefin Sans</b> The idea of this typeface is to be geometric, elegant, with a vintage feeling, for use at larger sizes. It is inspired by geometric sans serif designs from the 1920s. The x-height is half way from baseline to cap height, an unusual proportion.</p>

     <h3>Smokum & Teko</h3><br>
        <p><b>Smokum</b> Smokum is a western inspired slab-serif font with a little playful swagger to it. It's perfect for headlines and display uses that require a little loosened up country flair, but because of the contrast of thicks and thins, it will perform best as a WebFont at medium to large point sizes.
</p>
        <p><b>Teko</b> Teko is an Open Source typeface that currently supports the Devanagari and Latin scripts. This font family has been created for use in headlines and other display-sized text on screen. Five font styles make up the initial release.
Display families with extensive character sets are rare for any script. With Indian typefaces, however, large character sets are even less common. ITF’s designs are an exception. The Teko typeface features letterforms with low stroke contrast, square proportions and a structure that appears visually simple.
