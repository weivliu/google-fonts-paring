            Karla is a grotesque sans serif family designed for the Latin and Tamil 
            scripts.This is the Latin part of the family, which has been expanded 
            now to a variable font with a weight axis ranging from ExtraLight to 
            ExtraBold plus full support of Western, Central, and South-Eastern European languages.
         </p>
          <p>
            The idea of Josefin Sans is to be geometric, elegant, with a vintage feeling, for use 
            at larger sizes. It is inspired by geometric sans serif designs from the 1920s. 
            The x-height is half way from baseline to cap height, an unusual proportion.

            Smokum is a western inspired slab-serif font with a little playful 
            swagger to it. It's perfect for headlines and display uses that require 
            a little loosened up country flair, but because of the contrast of thicks 
            and thins, it will perform best as a WebFont at medium to large point sizes.

            Teko is an Open Source typeface that currently supports the Devanagari and Latin scripts. 
            This font family has been created for use in headlines and other display-sized text on screen. 
            Five font styles make up the initial release. Display families with extensive character sets 
            are rare for any script. With Indian typefaces, however, large character sets are even less common. 
            ITF’s designs are an exception. The Teko typeface features letterforms with low stroke contrast, 
            square proportions and a structure that appears visually simple. The Regular, Medium and Semibold 
            fonts are recommended for use in long headlines, while Bold is intended primarily for setting just 
            one or two words. The Light is a beautiful variant that may be put to exceptionally good use in 
            large headlines on websites. At display sizes, Teko works equally well on screen or in print. 
            Each font contains 1090 glyphs, offering full support for the conjuncts and ligatures required by 
            languages written with the Devanagari script. Teko is an excellent choice for use in advertising or 
            for news tickers on television screens (breaking news, etc.)

            A fresh decorative geometric grotesque with a hint of Art Deco 
            and c‘onstructivism. Poiret One is a unique typeface with light 
            forms and pure elegance. Sleek and simple. Based on geometric forms, 
            it has stylish lines and graceful curves. The font is applicable for 
            large signs, labels, titles, headlines and any type of graphic design 
            on the web, in motion graphics, or in print - from t-shirts to posters and logos. 
            It is also well-suited for short texts and advertising where style is desired. 
            Complete with a lower-case letters, the Poiret One is also useful for all-caps usage.
          </p>
          <p>
            Forum has antique, classic "Roman" proportions. It can be used to set body texts 
            and works well in titles and headlines too. It is truly multilingual, with glyphs 
            for Central and Eastern Europe, Baltics, Cyrillic and Asian Cyrillic communities.
