            Roboto has a dual nature. It has a mechanical skeleton and the forms
            are largely geometric. At the same time, the font features friendly
            and open curves. While some grotesks distort their letterforms to
            force a rigid rhythm, Roboto doesn’t compromise, allowing letters to
            be settled into their natural width. This makes for a more natural
            reading rhythm more commonly found in humanist and serif types.

            Cabin is a humanist sans inspired by Edward Johnston's and Eric
            Gill's typefaces, with a touch of modernism. Cabin incorporates
            modern proportions, optical adjustments, and some elements of the
            geometric sans. It remains true to its roots, but has its own
            personality.

            Cormorant is a free display type family developed by Christian
            Thalmann. The project currently comprises a total of 45 font files
            spanning 9 different visual styles (Roman, Italic, Infant, Infant
            Italic, Garamond, Garamond Italic, Upright Cursive, Small Caps, and
            Unicase) and 5 weights (Light, Regular, Medium, SemiBold, and Bold.)
            Cormorant was conceived, drawn, spaced, kerned, programmed,
            interpolated, and produced in its entirety by Christian Thalmann of
            Catharsis Fonts.

            Arvo is a geometric slab-serif typeface family suited for screen and
            print. The family includes 4 cuts: Roman, Italic, Roman Bold, Bold
            Italic. It is a libre font, first published in Google Fonts. The
            flavour of the font is rather mixed. It's monolinear-ish, but has a
            tiny bit of contrast (which increases the legibility a little in Mac
            OS X.)

          <p>
            Lato is a sans serif typeface family started in the summer of 2010
            by Warsaw-based designer Łukasz Dziedzic (“Lato” means “Summer” in
            Polish). In December 2010 the Lato family was published under the
            Open Font License by his foundry tyPoland, with support from Google.
